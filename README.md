# 🌡️ Apache Camel SOAP TempConverter

This repository demonstrates how to build a **SOAP-based temperature converter** using **Apache Camel (with CXF)** and **XSLT transformations**.

## 📖 Directory Overview

### 🔹 tempconverter/
- Shows two different routing strategies using xslt transformation:
  - **RAW mode** with inline choice logic ( choice when otherwise )
  - **RAW mode** with inline choice logic ( choice when otherwise ) + Body is set dynamically from file, fileName is set as run argument
  - **PAYLOAD mode** with dynamic routing (`toD (operationName)` + `direct` endpoints)
- Contains XSLT files in two variants:
  - With full SOAP envelopes (`*.xslt`) for RAW
  - With payload-only responses (`*-payload.xslt`) for PAYLOAD
- Contains XML files as request for calling Server as Client:
  - Sets Request body for F -> C (`f-to-c-req.xml`)
  - Sets Request body for C -> F (`c-to-f-req.xml`)
- Includes a Camel **timer client** that auto-sends requests for testing.
- You can change request in setBody step of timer route

👉 See [v1 README](./tempconverter/README.md) for full details.

## 🛠️ Running Any Version
- Install **Camel JBang**:
  ```bash
  curl -L https://camel.apache.org/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Run one of the route files, for example:
  ```bash
  camel run tempConvert.camel.yaml
  ```
- Test with SOAP clients (SoapUI, Postman, curl).

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Understand **Camel CXF** integration for SOAP services.
- Practice **XSLT transformations** with SOAP payloads.
- Explore different routing strategies (**RAW vs PAYLOAD**).
- Find common mistakes in SOAP/XSLT integration.
